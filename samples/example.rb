# The story: you have all sorts of logs, 
# and you want to get an idea how often certain 
# events occur each minute

# Perhaps you just want to know how many HTTP transactions occurred.
# Maybe you are worried about unauthorized access attempts.
# How about how many customers are flogging your api endpoint?

# You need to see the outliers.  Grepping through log files 
# in the midst of a crisis is very hard to do and quite unproductive.
# This is especially true in environments with lots of transactions. 

# With this tool, you can begin categorizing events 
# in your logs and trend them.  Then, when crisis hits, you can
# take a look at the graphs to see if anything suspicious has occurred 
# over the last few minutes.

  # Each time we read a line from the log file, we pass it to the block.
  # If your block returns true, we count that as a hit.
