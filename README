LogTrend is an event-driven HTTP log parser built on top of EventMachine.  It looks for patterns per your definition, and generates RRD graphs every minute.

There is a lot of room for improvement, but it works so far.

See the 'samples' folder for more info.

Major kudos to the people behind EventMachine and eventmachine-tail.
